# NLU Branch
This file contains information on how to go about trainng and testing our model. 
As we are not able to upload this amount of information, the whole codebase (for the NLU part) can be downloaded by visiting the [following link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wtz3tGZtTG6u3i7GEy3bKG6dAmbsICF0?usp=sharing). 
<br>
!!! Make sure to download the archive and extract it under `tudelft-conversational-agents-2021
/soloist/`

## Runing npm server
`tudelft-conversational-agents-2021/soloist/soloist/html$ npm install` <br>
`tudelft-conversational-agents-2021/soloist/soloist/html$ npm run serve`

## Runing Flask app
`tudelft-conversational-agents-2021/soloist/examples/reminderbot$ python reminderbot_server.py`

After running both of the above, you should be able to have everything set up for the NLU branch to be up and running. <br>
If you run the project in Furhat, you should be able to interact seamlessly with the trained agent. <br>
Last but not least, if you want to access the NLU branch, make sure to utter (at the very first bot interaction) any of the following words/sentences: 'task-oriented dialog', 'task dialog', 'oriented dialog', 'task'.
